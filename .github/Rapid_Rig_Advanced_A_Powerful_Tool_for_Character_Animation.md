Rapid Rig Advanced is not a free script, but it is worth the investment if you want to save time and effort in creating your own rigs. You can purchase it from Highend3D.com[^2^], where you can also find tutorials, videos, and customer reviews. Rapid Rig Advanced is compatible with Maya 2014 and above, and it works with Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.
 
However, if you are looking for a free alternative, you might want to avoid downloading Rapid Rig Advanced Torrent from dubious sources. Not only is this illegal and unethical, but it also exposes your computer to malware and viruses. Rapid Rig Advanced Torrent is a pirated version of the script that may not work properly or may contain harmful code. You are better off buying the original script from the official website or using other free rigging tools available online.
