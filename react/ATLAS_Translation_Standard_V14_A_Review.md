## Dictionary
 
ATLAS V14 comes with a standard dictionary that contains 2.88 million words. It covers general and common terms, as well as some technical terms. However, if you need more specialized vocabulary, you can also purchase additional technical dictionaries that contain 5.57 million words in 28 fields, such as medicine, law, engineering, and business[^1^]. You can also create your own dictionaries using the dictionary tools provided by ATLAS V14. You can add new words, edit existing entries, or import and export dictionaries in various formats.
 
## Functions
 
ATLAS V14 offers several functions that make translation easier and faster. One of them is the plugin function that allows you to translate documents directly from Microsoft Office applications (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) and Adobe Acrobat or Reader (PDF files). You can also translate web pages from Internet Explorer. The plugin function preserves the layout and formatting of the original documents as much as possible[^1^]. Another function is the translation memory function that stores translation examples consisting of paired original and translated sentences. ATLAS V14 uses a fuzzy match technology that can find not only exact matches but also similar sentences. This can help you avoid translating the same or similar sentences repeatedly and improve consistency[^2^]. ATLAS V14 also has a content-sensitive translation engine that can adjust the translation according to the context and style of the text.
 
## Performance
 
ATLAS V14 claims to provide high quality translations with a high level of accuracy. However, as with any machine translation software, it is not perfect and it cannot replace human translators. ATLAS V14 may make mistakes in grammar, syntax, word choice, idioms, or cultural references. It may also fail to capture the nuances, tone, or intention of the original text. Therefore, it is advisable to use ATLAS V14 as a tool to assist your translation process, not as a final product. You should always check and edit the output of ATLAS V14 before using it for any purpose.
 
## Conclusion
 
ATLAS Translation Standard V14 is a machine translation software package that can translate between Japanese and English. It has a comprehensive dictionary, a variety of functions, and a translation memory feature. It can help you translate documents and web pages quickly and easily. However, it is not flawless and it cannot replace human translators. You should always review and revise the output of ATLAS V14 before using it for any purpose.
