# Bhrigu Samhita: The Ancient Astrological Text
 
Bhrigu Samhita is a Sanskrit text that is attributed to Maharishi Bhrigu, one of the seven great sages of Hinduism. It is said to contain the horoscopes of millions of people who have lived or will live on this planet. It also reveals the past and future lives of a person based on their karma and planetary positions.

The text is divided into two parts: the first part deals with general principles of astrology, such as the characteristics of the zodiac signs, planets, houses, aspects, yogas, etc. The second part contains the predictions for each individual based on their birth chart. The predictions cover various aspects of life, such as health, wealth, marriage, children, career, spirituality, etc.
 
The Bhrigu Samhita is considered to be one of the most accurate and authentic sources of astrological knowledge. It is believed that Maharishi Bhrigu wrote the text by using his divine vision and intuition. He also consulted other sages and gods for guidance and verification. The text was originally written on palm leaves and stored in a library in Hoshiarpur, Punjab. However, over time, many of the leaves were lost or damaged due to natural calamities, wars, invasions, etc.
 
Today, only a few copies of the Bhrigu Samhita are available in India and abroad. Some of them are kept by private individuals or families who claim to be the descendants of Maharishi Bhrigu or his disciples. They offer readings to people who seek their services. However, not all of them are genuine or reliable. Some may have tampered with or fabricated the original text for personal gain or fame.
 
Therefore, one should be careful and discerning while seeking a reading from the Bhrigu Samhita. One should also remember that astrology is not a deterministic science, but a probabilistic one. It can indicate the tendencies and possibilities of a person's life based on their karma and free will. It cannot override the divine plan or the individual's choice. Ultimately, one's destiny is shaped by one's actions and attitude.

How to Get a Reading from the Bhrigu Samhita
 
If you are curious about your past, present and future lives as revealed by the Bhrigu Samhita, you might be wondering how to get a reading from this ancient text. There are different ways to access the wisdom of the Bhrigu Samhita, depending on your preference and availability.
 
One way is to visit a library or an archive that has a copy of the Bhrigu Samhita. However, this is not an easy task, as there are very few places that have preserved the original palm leaves or manuscripts of the text. Moreover, you will need to have some knowledge of Sanskrit and astrology to read and interpret the text yourself.
 
Another way is to consult a person or a family who claims to have a copy of the Bhrigu Samhita and offers readings to people. However, this is also not a reliable option, as there are many frauds and impostors who have either tampered with or fabricated the text for their own benefit. You will need to be very careful and discerning while choosing a genuine and trustworthy reader.

This is a convenient and affordable option, as you can get a personalized and detailed report of your horoscope based on the principles of the Bhrigu Samhita.
